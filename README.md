# ActionScript 3 try...catch Block Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with error handling in ActionScript 3's try...catch blocks.  The try...catch statement might not always catch every type of error, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior or crashes.

## Bug Description:

The `bug.as` file shows an example where a try...catch block might fail to handle certain runtime errors effectively.  The lack of comprehensive error handling within the try...catch block might result in unhandled exceptions, possibly causing the application to halt unexpectedly without informative error messages.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.as` file provides a more robust error-handling mechanism to address the potential shortcoming of the original try...catch block.  It incorporates improved error detection, logging, and alternative recovery strategies to handle a wider range of potential runtime exceptions.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Compile and run `bug.as`
2. Observe the potential for unhandled errors.
3. Then, compile and run `bugSolution.as` to see an example of better error handling.
